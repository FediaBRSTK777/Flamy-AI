# Flamy — AI Dating App

Flamy is an experimental dating app that connects people with personality-rich AI companions. This repository contains a React + Vite + TypeScript prototype and a small gallery of AI-generated characters.

All characters shown in the gallery are AI girls generated by me using my personal LLM.

## About Flamy
Flamy is a creative playground for exploring conversational design, character personalities, and safe simulated social interactions. It focuses on fun prototypes rather than production-ready matchmaking.

## AI Girls Gallery
Below are the AI girls stored in the `mainGirls` folder. Each image is labeled "AI girl — generated by my LLM".

<!-- Replace the placeholder filenames below with actual filenames from ./mainGirls -->
- AI girl — generated by my LLM  
  ![AI Girl 1](./mainGirls/image1.jpg)

- AI girl — generated by my LLM  
  ![AI Girl 2](./mainGirls/image2.png)

- AI girl — generated by my LLM  
  ![AI Girl 3](./mainGirls/image3.jpg)

(Replace or add entries to match the files in ./mainGirls)

## A little story
Each AI girl can be given a short backstory, a mood, and a conversation style. Imagine switching on a profile and getting a poem, a joke, or a thoughtful conversation — Flamy is for playful experimentation with companionship-like dialogue.

## Attribution & Use
All images in this gallery were generated by me using my personal LLM and are included here with that attribution. Use responsibly and respect ethical guidelines when experimenting with simulated personas.
